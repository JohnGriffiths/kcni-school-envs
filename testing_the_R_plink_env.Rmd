This is an [R Markdown](http://rmarkdown.rstudio.com) Notebook. When you execute code within the notebook, the results appear beneath the code. 

Try executing this chunk by clicking the *Run* button within the chunk or by placing your cursor inside it and pressing *Ctrl+Shift+Enter*. 

Add a new chunk by clicking the *Insert Chunk* button on the toolbar or by pressing *Ctrl+Alt+I*.

## Printing the R settings

First we will load, using the `library` command, all the packages that we will want to use during this project.

```{r}
library(tidyverse)
library(rms)
library(ggthemes)
library(ggrepel)
library(ggsci)
```

Then we will use `sessionInfo()` to print all the environment information.

```{r}
sessionInfo()
```

## Check plink install

Lastly, we will check the install of `plink` by calling the help function.

_Note that we are using the `sh` in to indicate to R markdown that this is bash code_


```{sh}
plink --help
```

```{sh}
PRSice_linux -help
```

```{sh}
PRSice.R -h
```
